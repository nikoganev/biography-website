I can change style of everything(font, color, links, etc). Another option can be that you send me a wireframe and guidelines and I built the website from there.
I can build custom wireframe and website color guidelines for you. After understanding your vision for the website and your business needs I will create and deliver a pdf file with the wireframe.</description>
