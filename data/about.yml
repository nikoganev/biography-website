title   : Why Am I Different
description: >
    What sets me apart from the competition is that I'm passionate about the products/services I provide to my clients and quality of support I give. I provide a mix of services suited to personal websites/blogs and online business owners. I'm always looking to improve every aspect of my business and the value I provide.

    You will always receive more than what I confirm to deliver. I will work closely with you to create a site that achieves your aims.

    I follow the policies of search engines such as Google to give your site the best possible chance of coming up in search results.

    I like to think thatâ€™s because I have taken a long-term view in a field where many web designers, who may provide wonderful-looking websites, often leave their clients unable to update their sites or make any changes.
