### BUILDING A WEBSITE FROM A TEMPLATE

Creating and building your website on your own taste. We can start from a Template and then moving around sections and navigation menu. I can change style of everything(font, color, links, etc). Another option can be that you send me a wireframe and guidelines and I built the website from there.

I can build custom wireframe and website color guidelines for you. After understanding your vision for the website and your business needs I will create and deliver a pdf file with the wireframe. Then on separate pdf file you will receive a guidelines with styling for font family, colors and headers. You will have 1 revision and a chance to make changes to the wireframe. Then you will receive the final version. This is a separate package that I offer, check [Brand Guidelines](/feature/brand-guidelines).

This package doesn't include the content writing for the website. I offer a separate package for the [content writing](/feature/content-writing).

If you are not good with programming but you want to edit regularly your website, the template use Markdown language, which helps you edit really easy. You will still have to use the terminal of your computer to make version changes to your files. If you still don't want to deal with writing commands and pull/push changes I suggest you to use a static CMS system. It's really easy to use and everyone with basic knowledge can do it.
